# The Darkest Timeline - A Tables Project

### Introduction

In this project, we'll create a Darkest Timeline (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remedial_Chaos_Theory). Using tables!

### Content

You can choose any one of the following two methods for coming up with content for your timeline:

1. Choose a series of events in real life, your personal life or general history, that ended badly. For example, a bad breakup. Or the beginning of World War I.

2. Make something up! Brownie Points for creativity. (Brownie points are not redeemable for actual brownies. Nor, in fact, are they redeemable for anything at all.) Make sure it ends Sadly Ever After.

Either way, your timeline must have _at least_ five events.


### Presentation

Armed with your timeline, you'll make an `html` `<table>` that shows its events, in chronological order (which is... what a timeline is, I guess). Each event should have:

* a title,
* a date or time,
* and a description of the event.

Now here's the tricky part: you're going to make TWO TABLES.

They should have the same timeline, but one should present it vertically, and one should present it horizontally.

A vertical example: http://fptd.kbm1.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/5-Years-Film-Timeline-PPT-Diagrams-1.jpg

A horizontal example: https://venngage-wordpress.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/09/timeline-template-6-1.png

Happy tabling!


### Stretch Goals

* Add a row/column with an image for each event. Store the image _locally_, preferably in a subdirectory of your project.
* Make a separate page for each table. Be sure to give the user a link from each page to the other, with clear link text so they know where they're going for the best user experience.
* Add table headings for each column or row (depending on the layout!). Look up the `<th>` tag!
* Change the content of your second table to add a "brightest" timeline version of the same events. Finally, a story that doesn't use tragedy as a narrative crutch!
